# Rock Paper Scissors Web Game
This web application was created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no framework). The application was based on Dev Ed's Rock Paper Scissors Game tutorial as a part of JavaScript course at Metropolia UAS (Helsinki, Finland). The application is pretty straight-forward, and easy to use. Click <em>Let's Play</em> to begin playing, and <em>Play Again</em> to reset results to 0-0. On each play, click on the option you want to choose (either Rock, Paper or Scissors), and wait for the result ðŸ˜‰ Any contribution or feedback would be much appreciated.
